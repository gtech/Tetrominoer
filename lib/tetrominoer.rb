# Enumerate all possible position matrices for each piece type
# create aray with all 9 pieces
# Start with the first piece in its first position matrix, then add onto it the second piece first matrix. If there is a two in the solution matrix go to the next second piece matrix. 
# Once you have a successful second piece do this again with the third etc.
# If you get to the end of a piece's position matrices, start again with the next first piece's matrix
# If however you are on hte last piece's matrix and all values are correct, print the matrix for each piece.

#Take in the dimentions of the board and produce a matrix for all
