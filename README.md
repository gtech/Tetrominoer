# Tetrominoer

This is a simple gem for solving four block polyomino puzzles with arbitrarily sized play spaces.
I'm writing this as a fun side project to 'The Talos Principle', which I highly recommend playing.

I'm hoping the code will generalize to solve (n)-omino puzzles if you alter block.rb, but testing that isn't
in the scope of this project.
